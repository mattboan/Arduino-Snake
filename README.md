# Arduino-Snake
A simple Snake clone for the Arduino and the ST7735 TFT LCD.

Don't worry I will be updating and improving the code as soon as I get the chance. Keep in mind i wrote this code last year, and was just happy I could get it to run.

You will need to have the Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_ST7735, and SPI libraries.
